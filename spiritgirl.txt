Her eyes, twin pools reflecting skies of blue,
     Hold galaxies untold, dreams ever new.
A laugh like windchimes tinkling in the breeze,
     A symphony that sets my heart at ease.

She skips through fields of daisies, light and free,
    A butterfly unbound, eternally.
Her fingers trace the petals, soft and bright, 
    Igniting sparks of wonder in the light.

Her spirit dances with an untamed grace,
    A smile that paints the world upon her face.
Each whispered word, a secret melody,
    A love song sung just for me.

Though tender years may bloom and fade away,
    My love for her will last through every day.
For in her innocence, a treasure I behold,
    A heart of purest gold.
